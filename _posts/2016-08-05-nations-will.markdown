The July of 2016 was a time of great change for the Republic of Turkey, when the
lord almighty had descended from his heavenly throne, and personally attended
the complete and utter cleansing of Central Anatolia from the vile things that
once inhabited it.

No, wait... That didn't happen yet, did it? Ahem, spoiler alert much. Please
ignore what I had just said. A great man once said there is great virtue in
fresh starts. I think.

It is a great pleasure to meet you. *Insert firm and manly handshake.* I
am the author of this blog, and it is my absolute delight to welcome you to
<strong>Articles of Apathy</strong>, the most interesting series of articles
that you can find on the World Wide Web. Oh, how I am filled with joy thinking
about the wonderful places my train of thought will take us to, like a magical
Orient Express. I am sincerely jealous of you, reader.

A great blog deserves a great introduction. So here is a story about a bus ride
that I took on my way to home. It is a small glimpse at an ordinary day that you
can spend in my hometown in Central Anatolia, also known as the Toilet of
Turkey. Please note that the story represents my unadulterated experience,
despite the cynical tone that followed up until this point.

<hr/>

*2 AM. Standing at a bus stop in the suburbs 20 kilometers from downtown,
waiting for the bus to take me even further outside the city to the nether realm
that harbors the desolate apartment complex that I call home.*

*By the way, if you are reading this in a future that The Republic of
Turkey no longer exists, here is some background information. Turkey was a
sovereign state that governed Asia Minor in around 20th century A.D., home to
the people that call themselves "Turks", with the capital located in the city of
Yozgat.*

*Now what was interesting about this particular period during the summer of
2016 was that Turkey was hosting its decennial national sports event, the much
acclaimed coup d'Ã©tat. However, the present event was organized very poorly due
to uncontrollable circumstances, and was deemed a complete failure from the
minute it was announced. Consequently, the people were very angry, and went off
to streets rioting. The city administration, afraid that the people will get
more mad, blessed the public with free transportation, and put night buses and
trains to relieve any discomfort caused to the people by their own rioting. The
bus drivers, of course, rejoiced at the fact that they could help their citizen
brothers and sisters 24 hours a day, and put in an even more diligent effort
into taking the tired warriors off the streets and to their resting places.*

The night shifts meant that I could just chill hanging out around the city, and
not have the usual panic attack of "holy shit it's 11pm, I will <span
style="text-decoration:underline;">die</span> on the streets if I don't leave
for the bus in 12 seconds". Being the lax guy that I am, I took my time hanging
out, and arranged my departure so that I was on the bus at 2 in the morning,
along with my warrior comrades whom I went on to congratulate heartily for their
brave efforts at saving our democracy. Content with finding an empty seat and
not being in contact with any sweaty body, I settled in around the middle of the
bus. The bus took off, and knowing that I would be in my bed in half an hour, I
dozed off a little.

After about 2 hours, or 2 minutes, I jolted awake with a feeling that you get
when you go on a safari in the Savannah, and you are on the wrong side of the
window together with very big cats. I could not recognize any of my surroundings
outside the bus, and despite the feeling of being lost, the bus was venturing
even speedier into the unknown. My eyes caught the equally confused faces of my
citizen brothers, to whom I proceeded to ask:

"Isn't this the bus to [District that I live in]?"<br>
"Yes, it is...?"<br>
"Then why are we in [District that is far away from the place that I live in]?"<br>
"No idea..."<br>
"Did anyone speak with the driver? Maybe he doesn't know the route?"<br>
"..."

At which point, I realized that if I wanted to sleep tonight and not walk the
not-so-usual 15 kilometer detour to my bed, I had to confront the brains of the
vehicle. I hurriedly got off my seat and flung myself toward the front section
of the bus. As I approached the driver, I could already sense that something was
wrong, because the guy was talking to himself in a quiet, but rash voice. As I
tried to furnish the politest tone that I could manage, and asked "Mr. Captain
of the Bus, is this really the bus to [My district]?", the captain's nervous but
pleading words exploded in my face:

"I don't know, I don't know where I am... Where am I? God, if I can
*ever* manage to put my hands on him, I will give him an adequate
beating. Give me patience God..."

Startled by the response, I pondered the meaning behind those words, and
realized two things at once:

- That the captain did not know where he was going.
- That the captain was very angry at someone whom I did not recognize yet.

Of these two facts, the first one was the one that was of most interest to me. I
decided to convey the fact that we should not have been going to where we
were headed at that moment, but to someplace else.

"Would you like me to show you the way? I can use GPS..."<br>
"Yeah, yeah. Whatever..."

And just like that, I was the honorary co-captain of the bus. It was an
exhilarating feeling, knowing that I had the power to take a city-assigned bus
anywhere I wanted. Indeed, after a few turns, we were on the right track, and I
was trying hard not to be discouraged by the guy standing behind me, also trying
to help and give directions. Although both of our directions eventually led the
bus to the same road, I was contempt of this rival who was trying to steal my
moment of heroism. Fortunately, I did not yield, and seeing that I had superior
technology, my nemesis receded to the back of the bus.

As we finally joined the highway that we were supposed to be on, the captain asked:

"Where are we? Are we around [Mall that is 15 km away from current location]?"<br>
"No, we are 15 km away from it."

Hearing that statement, the captain let out a cry of despair that moved
something in me, and shifted my perspective on bus drivers permanently:

"Motherfucker... What kind of place is this? Where the hell did they assign me
to?"

I gotta admit, it is a bit heart breaking when even the bus driver disses your
town. And knowing that he was right did not help alleviate the existential dread
I was so suddenly pulled into. I asked:

"Where do they normally assign you to, sir?"<br>
"[Town that I don't immediately recognize], and prison."

First of all, I was a bit surprised that there was a bus stop to the prison.
Then, I realized that the prison was in fact not "the" prison, but probably one
of the many prisons that are located in my wonderful hometown, and wondered
which one it was. Then, I realized that I was drifting off with this train of
thought, and at once allowed myself to become offended by the fact that my town
had been compared to a prison, and lost. In the meanwhile, the captain had
started rambling yet again, flinging swearwords all around and fantasizing about
his future encounter with the mysterious John Doe who appeared to be the root of
the captain's problems:

"Sonuvabitch... How can you help it if you are son of a bitch, and a bastard?"
*Rhetorical question, I presume.* "Oh just you wait, just you wait till I
put my hands on you, I'll tear you into pieces. Son of a bitch..."

This got my attention, and I felt that it was the right time to satisfy my
curiosity about this stranger whom I had first heard of when I was initially
approaching the captain, and had been wondering ever since.

"Sir, if you allow me this indulgence, may I ask whom you are referring to? This
lady or gentleman seems to have brought great discomfort on your behalf."
"Who? Who could it be? The fucking son of a bitch who sent me here. The fucking
dispatcher. But you can't help it if you are a son of a bitch, can you? *Son
of a bitch...*"

> As a side note, I have to say that "son of a
> bitch" sounds much more offensive in Turkish than in English, with an emphasis
> like a verbal punch in the 3rd and 4th syllables, making you feel like you have
> just been hit on the face with projectile vomit.

And just like that, the pieces fell into place, painting a complete picture of
this tragedy that we were experiencing in the middle of nowhere, with the chain
of events unfolding from the moment that the son of a bitch cocksucker
dispatcher decided to dispatch this poor soul to a route he has never been to.
The captain, a mere servant without the ability to object to his superior, whose
only desire was to finish his shift and bring bread to his family, stranded in
the middle of nowhere. Us, the inhabitants of the bus' destination, who *had
to* live in the middle of nowhere. The veil had been lifted from my eyes,
and I understood at once my place in the machine, and its relation to the
Nation's Will.

I surely did not expect to go through such an existential crisis at 2 AM on the
way to home, and wondered whether I already had it the moment I stepped in the
bus, or when I woke up that morning. These thoughts unraveled as I realized that
we were close to exiting the highway, and the captain needed further
instructions.

An earlier discourse with passengers while we were on the highway had revealed
that I was the only one in the bus who needed to go to the specific part of town
that I resided, as opposed to the 20 people who would rather have the bus go to
the opposite direction, which would save them five minutes on the ride. And as I
expected, one of the passengers suggested exactly that, which I reciprocated
with fire. I told him that I shall not walk the three kilometer way to home at 2
AM. I addressed his conscience by reminiscing a past experience of me getting
chased by dogs in the exact location he suggested to drop me off. I knew I did
not have to add that last part, it was just basic courtesy to convince him that
his precious five minutes were lost for a good cause. I knew that I had the
power, that the captain was now my bitch, and that he would have taken me
wherever I wanted. But I would not have allowed it to corrupt me.

I instructed the captain to skip the usual route, and take me directly to home,
as I was the only one who was headed to that part of the town. The part of the
ride up until this point was essential also to the other passengers, but not
anymore. I realized and enjoyed the fact that the captain had now become my own
chauffeur. I delivered my instructions gracefully, all the time being grateful
that it was me and not someone else who took on the task of helping out the
captain. Because I knew that it would have ended up with me being chased by dogs
in the middle of the night.

As a final act of grace, I did not let the captain take a turn that would have
added the ride another half kilometer, and instead allowed him to drop me off
some 200 meters away from my apartment. As I watched the bus get smaller and
disappear, I felt a rush of serenity and basked in it. I thought that by not
pushing my luck too much and providing a small sacrifice in the form of a
200-meter walk to home, I was sending out a positive message to the universe,
karma, and Jesus. I could not help but make a gesture of victory and relief with
my arms up in the air, kind of like the one those Wall Street guys make when
they do not lose their lives' savings in a matter of seconds. I knew that I
would be sleeping in my own bed tonight and not be mauled by dogs, frozen to
death or raped by a vagrant. If you think that I am exaggerating, I oblige you
to understand that these are perfectly valid scenarios not just in my city, but
in the entire country. Wow, bleak much.

<hr/>

I woke up next morning, feeling that I should share this story with someone.
After sharing with a friend and getting a few laughs in return, I realized that
I should share it with more people. So I shared it with more people. Then I
realized it was not enough, and I had to share it with the whole world. So I
created this blog. Then I wrote a crude translation of the story, and after
finishing, I started writing a conclusion. And then I wrote this sentence. And
now this brought my attention to the present moment, where I realize that this
whole thing is not just about this single story, but about all the weird shit
that currently exists in my mind as un-form, waiting to be dredged out into our
reality.

It will be magnificent.
