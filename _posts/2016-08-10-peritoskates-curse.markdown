# His Life

In the gorges of mount Olympus, just outside the shiny palace complex that
houses the twelve divinities whose job is to bring order to the entirety of
creation, dwells a demigod in a makeshift shrine, completely enshrouded in vines
and litter, as to give the occasional passer-by the impression that the Olympian
municipality does not value sanitation and public health as much as one would
expect. <!--more-->
The demigod, whose name is known only to a handful remaining disciples
and a few pedantic Greek scholars, leaves his residence only twice a year during
the solstices to descend down the mountain, roam the surrounding cities, collect
useless and abandoned items from people's homes, and retrieve them to his shrine
which was constructed magically as for to allow infinite storage, albeit in a
way that makes it really hard to move freely inside. If you gathered the courage
to approach this untidy museum and peek through the door, you would witness
beside the cardboard boxes that tower all the way up to the ceiling and the
miscellany that cover all visible surfaces, the demigod in his half year long
slumber: Peritoskates, the god of collectors, accumulators and hoarders.

The story of Peritoskates is a sad one, and a very sad one indeed. Conceived
when Zeus, the god of faithfulness, decided to have a yet another romantic
escapade with a mortal woman who was oblivious to the fact that thunderstorms
beset the neighbourhood every time that they have had sex. And it is important
to remember that this was long before Eros had a change of mind and decided to
become the god of contraception. So was little Peritoskates born, to a loving
mother, and an indifferent father, who had better things to do than to raise a
son, like sitting on a throne and holding a stick that can shoot lightnings.
This was only the beginning of Peritoskates' tragedy, however, for when Zeus'
wife Hera heard about the relationship, she just "couldn't chill", and went on
to make Peritoskates' mother, whose name is long forgotten, eat a poisoned apple
out of revenge. This act of pure hatred finally moved something in Zeus, when he
identified his wife as the root cause of his past promiscuity, and finally grew
the balls to get a divorce. He vowed not to have sex with random strangers, and
to look after this specific son of his from that day on. Of these two promises,
it took about a week to break the first one. But he had really meant it with his
second promise, and he made sure to be around little Peritoskates till his
coming of age; just long enough to raise a broken individual and be sure that he
will not be able to recover from it.

Of the many faculties the king of the gods had, being a good and sensible father
was not among them. When he took in baby Peritoskates to his own palace, and
gave him special chambers to grow up in, the other gods whispered among
themselves, disapproved of this unwise decision, and pitied the poor soul who
will be brought up by the guy who literally electrocutes his opponents when he
gets angry during a debate. Once, Zeus could not get his demigod son to eat the
demi-food he needed to develop, because Peritoskates was always preoccupied with
playing with his toys, even at the dinner table. So he made a habit of taking
Peritoskates' toys away from him before dinner, forgetting to give them back to
him afterwards, partially because he was generally busy with being the ruler of
heaven's throne. This would shock little Peritoskates to his core, and not being
able to take his precious possessions back from this ripped, white-bearded
father figure would bring him great anguish.

Peritoskates at times, being the child he was, would see something that he would
like to own, like a football, a Bionicle®, or one of his
father's lightnings, and start to demand that his father buy it for him, or give
it to him. Being the tough guy he was, Zeus knew better than to submit to the
will of a semi-mortal child, so he would reject these demands profusely. Only
after months of begging on a single worthless item would Zeus finally succumb to
the ever-consolidating nagging of his son, giving him what he had wanted. Zeus
was not a dick, but he was not very nice either. He rarely spoke to his son and
brought home random girlfriends who did not stay more than a healthy personal
bond would last, laying the foundations of Peritoskates' trust issues and
introversion.

Peritoskates did not have many friends due to his constant hanging out around
the king's palace, and he had all the time in the world to attend to his private
possessions and spend time with each object that he owned, soak in the details
such as shape and colour, and befriend them. In his mind, each possession had a
special place no matter its use, and he did not even consider disposing of even
one of them. In time, his collection grew, and he needed a second room in the
palace just to hold the items that he owned; he was going down a slope that was
really difficult to turn from. Things did not change even when he started
god-school, and was forced to socialize: he was a misfit among all the god and
demigod children due to him being the son of the guy who literally controls the
fucking weather. Instead, a whole new universe of collection was unlocked before
him: he would spend hours in the Olympus stationery, picking out pencils,
notebooks, post-its, highlighters, paper-clips that he did not need. He saw his
classmates play with baseball cards, and invested a fortune in completing his
collection of pictures of unfit men. This was around the time when he felt the
need to ask his father for a second storage room, and when Zeus pondered that
there might be something wrong going on with his son, not that he took any
measures to counter it.

So grew Peritoskates, rushing from his father's palace to school, then back to
his storage, where he enjoyed the company of his collections. It was around the
time he entered puberty that he began to realize that he was an individual, and
he could define himself to be anything. He liked to think of himself as an avid
collector. He read books on collection, he talked collection, and everywhere he
went, he saw nothing but items that were his to collect. His collections easily
filled up a quarter of the palace's empty chambers, and Zeus was absolutely
unhappy about the situation, but also too indifferent to confront his son and
his problems. So when the time came for Peritoskates to go to god-college, Zeus
used it as an excuse to kick him out, then took his son's belongings and moved
them to an abandoned shrine on the outskirts of the palace, not before putting
on some spells that would render it as voluminous as one needed it to be,
because the shrine was too small for all his son's shit to fit.

There are other details to Peritoskates' story, but knowing them would not make
a difference in terms of the point I am trying to make. Peritoskates went to
god-college, and when the time came for him to select a major and a discipline,
he chose to concentrate on collecting, and upon graduation, became the god of
keeping things that we do not need. Circumstances led Peritoskates to invest
divine power and become a professional at never losing or discarding anything
you own, not even the obscurest belonging that you have permitted to stand in a
shadowy corner of your wardrobe for twelve years, before finding it that one day
and wondering to yourself why the fuck you have not thrown it away years ago.
Whenever you pause for an instance before you throw away that one notebook from
primary school that you have kept, or the yoghurt machine that you have received
as a present in the 90's but do not remember from whom it was, or the troll
keychain that has been in your desk drawer since you learned how to read,
Peritoskates lets out a facial expression that is between a smile and a frown
laying still in his deep slumber, in his ever-expanding shrine on the outskirts
of the divine palace on Mount Olympus.

# His Legacy

As Peritoskates' legend became popular amongst the Ancient Greek folk,
superstition followed whenever a child started to show symptoms of hoarding:
they believed that the child was touched by Peritoskates while he was collecting
items from the house, and was cursed into the same addiction that he has,
although one needs to be subjected to the negligence of a literal god-father in
order to obtain a hoarding habit that advanced. And the Greeks, being the
obsessive-compulsive admirers of tidiness they were, tried everything to break
his curse, and after a long series of trial and error, found out that slapping
the child in the face repeatedly with a large smelly fish eventually helped the
child give up this abhorrent habit, albeit with undesired side-effects.

The main problem for the Greeks was that the hoarder could not be persuaded by
the infallible logic that "if you don't get rid of some of your possessions
immediately, you *will* be crushed to death under the tower of National
Geographic magazines garnishing your nightstand". It was not until the late 18th
century when the famous French cook Antoine Lavoisier was so disgusted by his
girlfriend's hoarding that he hypothesized successfully the physical law for the
conservation of mass:

> *Donne-moi une fessée s’il te plait. Je suis un garçon vilain.*

which translates into

> *The amount of shit you own is equal to the shit you buy, subtracted by the
> shit you discard.*

This idea was downright groundbreaking and revolutionary, and indeed caused the
French Revolution when the bourgeoisie realized that they could just get rid of
the monarchy, which was basically a collection of fancy dresses and oil
paintings of guys wearing wigs. Indeed, the only way to cure this disease is to
make the patient understand that if they want to be able to move around in the
limited volume of a domicile, they must either change the laws of physics, or
start throwing away the things that they do not need.

The problem is that such a person simply does not know how to differentiate
between a useful object, and the plaster cast from that one time when they broke
their arm in 3rd grade, which they cannot throw away because it has the
signatures of all the classmates from back then. One needs to either learn by
experience, or in the absence of experience, be taught how to decide whether to
hold or keep an object they own. In her book *How to Use Soft Words to
Convince Hoarders to Throw Away Their Shit,* Marie Kondo comes up with a
solution that sounds too good to be true:

> I came to the conclusion that the best way to
> choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one’s hand
> and ask: “Does this spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This
> is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to
> judge.

Indeed, if one wants their book to be taken seriously by a target demographic
that does not just consist of 17-year-old suburban white girls, one should not
use expressions such as "to spark joy" or "feminine lifestyle".

When it comes to it, it is really hard to decide whether to break up or not with
a cherished belonging. From time to time, I throw away an object and instantly
regret it even though it has fulfilled its purpose and we have kissed goodbye.
There is no method that guarantees that you will not miss a discarded object,
and you just have to accept that in order to have a functional space, you have
to go through the emotional pain of losing stuff which is a feeling akin to
erasing memories out of your brain. I cannot give you a foolproof sieve
algorithm for discarding your stuff, but I can sure as hell point fingers to the
perpetrators of this problem.

I say, blame the system, which promotes hoarding in the first place. Blame the
communist government that governs so shittily that it can only suppress its
citizens' existential crises by making them collect postal stamps and old coins.
Blame the capitalist government that equates money to happiness, which you can
only use to buy more stuff:

> ... and then the other thing that
> we seem to have bought into in a big way is consumerism. That's what people use,
> they fill the void, you know, stuff. "Give me the thing, give me the couch, the
> wig, the tiny beans, the radio, the CD's, the shoes ...", all these stuff, all
> the time, that you can't get away from. You know you bought a lot of shit,
> because you are broke now, and your house is full of shit. You walk around the
> house looking for a pencil, or a piece of paper. You can't find anything useful
> like that. But you can always put your hands on a purple furry cube with the
> number six on the side and rubber legs underneath. And you pick it up, and go
> "What is this shit? Why is it in the house?". Because you bought it, that's why.
> Like all the other crap that you never use.
>
> There are people in the middle of Sydney, driving around in those huge 4x4
> vehicles. They are like little houses on the move. You can't even see the people
> inside, they're so high up. The man on the mobile phone is going *bla bla
> bla* about money, or the ladies with the Roman candle of blonde hair going
> *hiya hiya hiya* as they plough through schoolchildren. Roaring around up
> and down the streets while your children play, in their fucking Toyota
> Hiroshimus. So they can get to the mall quicker, to buy more shit, to put it in
> the house. The jewelry, the clothes, the perfume...
>
> *Dylan Moran, What It Is (2009)*

Blame Zeus for giving everything to Peritoskates except the only thing he
actually needed, a father. After all, if hoarders are hoarding to suppress their
problems, and the problems were caused by an outside factor, then they alone
cannot be held accountable for their actions. Whether it is a personal
relationship, the government's actions, or the god of skies that sucks so bad
that it pushes you to seek happiness in inanimate objects, you can always resist
and protest by fighting the urge to collect and keep, and start throwing that
shit away. Because every time you dispose of useless crap, Peritoskates moans in
his slumber ecstatically, and if you throw away enough stuff, you have the
opportunity of giving him the best orgasm he might have this season.
